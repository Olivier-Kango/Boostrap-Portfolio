# Try Bootstrap

## Learning objectives
- Understand the concept of CSS frameworks.
- Use documentation for CSS frameworks.

### Estimated time: 4h

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will experience the power of using a CSS framework like Bootstrap to create a new website quickly from scratch. You are going to create a prototype of the portfolio website from scratch in a few hours - are you ready for the challenge?

### Instructions
*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise.*

- First, you need to create a new repository for this exercise, and start working in a 'feature' branch.
- Do not re-use your portfolio code! As you will see, using Bootstrap you will barely need to write any CSS, just use Bootstrap classes.
- Install Bootstrap in your project, including both CSS and JS files.
- Start prototyping the desktop version of the portfolio.
- Explore all the Bootstrap components to see which ones you may need. For this exercise you don't need to personalize them to adjust to the design template. Here is a list of some components that could be useful:
  - [navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/) and [nav](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navs-tabs/) for the header.
  - [scrollspy](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/scrollspy/) to update the active menu link when the user scrolls.
  - [cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) for the list of portfolio projects.
  - [buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/).
  - [badges](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/badge/) for the list of technologies.
  - [modals](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/) for the popup window with the project details.
  - [Bootstrap forms components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/) to create the contact form.
  - [the grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/) to place elements inline with others.
- Once you have finished the desktop version, explore how to use [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) to adapt the website to the mobile design.
- When everything is ready, open a new pull request with a detailed description of what you did.
- **You need to use pair-programming for this exercise. We will check to make sure that both partners have contributed to the exercise by looking at the commit history of the project. Therefore you need to select one of the portfolios in your pair-programming group in which you will implement the above features.**
